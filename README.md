# Transposition_Cipher
Transposition Cipher | Encryption/Decryption | C++ |

Description:
This C++ program implements the Transposition Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. The Transposition Cipher is a classical cryptographic technique that rearranges the letters of a message based on a given key.

Features:
- Allows users to encrypt plaintext messages using the Transposition Cipher.
- Provides an option for users to decrypt Transposition Cipher-encrypted messages.
- Supports input of messages containing spaces and special characters.
- Validates the input to ensure that the key is not greater than the length of the message.
- Displays the encrypted or decrypted text on the console.
- Offers the ability to save the encrypted or decrypted text to a user-specified file.

Usage:
1. Choose between Transposition Encryption or Transposition Decryption from the menu.
2. For Transposition Encryption:
   - Enter the message to be encrypted.
   - Specify the key (referred to as "rail" in the program).
   - The program will generate the encrypted text and display it on the console.
   - The encrypted text can be saved to a file of your choice.
3. For Transposition Decryption:
   - Enter the encrypted message.
   - Provide the key used for encryption.
   - The program will decrypt the message and display the original text on the console.
   - The decrypted text can also be saved to a file.

Note: Make sure to compile and run the program using a C++ compiler to use the Transposition Cipher encryption and decryption functionality.

This program can be a helpful tool for individuals interested in learning about or experimenting with the Transposition Cipher encryption technique. It can also serve as a reference implementation for developers who want to incorporate Transposition Cipher functionality into their own applications or projects.

Feel free to customize and modify the code to fit your specific needs. Contributions and improvements are welcome.
